## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

The following tools and technologies are used throughout this internship:

### ✅ Core Web Technologies
- **HTML5** – semantic layout, structure
- **CSS3** – styling, positioning, hover effects, animations
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – DOM manipulation, interactivity

### ✅ Styling Enhancements
- **Flexbox** – for layout and alignment
- **Media Queries** – for responsive design
- **Linear Gradients** – for aesthetic hover states and backgrounds
- **Google Fonts** – for modern typography (e.g., Montserrat)
- **CSS Transitions** – for smooth animations
- **Background Images** – full-screen responsive designs

### ✅ UI Components
- **Sidebar Navigation** – with icons and dynamic behavior
- **Hamburger Menu** – for mobile-friendly sidebar toggling
- **Overlay System** – to focus attention when sidebar is open
- **Logout Highlighting** – with warning color gradients

### ✅ File & Asset Management
- Organized folder structure with:
  - `/images` for SVG icons and backgrounds
  - Separate files for HTML, CSS, JS
  - README for documentation

## 📱 Responsiveness

All UI layouts are designed to be **fully responsive** across:

- 📱 Mobile phones (≤600px)
- 🖥️ Desktops and large screens (1440px+)

Responsive behavior is achieved using **CSS media queries**, **relative units**, and **flex-based positioning**.

## 📌 JavaScript Features Used

- Sidebar open/close logic using event listeners
- Overlay toggling with `display` and `z-index`
- Menu toggle state using Boolean variable
- Controlled visibility for cross-button
- `style.width` and `style.display` manipulation

## 📝 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1 – Responsive Sidebar Dashboard
- Sidebar with navigation icons (Home, About, Login, Contact, Logout)
- Hamburger icon to toggle sidebar
- Linear gradient hover effects
- Background image on main content
- Responsive layout with media queries

> _More tasks will be added here as the internship progresses..._
